# Algorithms

Simple (simplistic?) of the following known algorithms and data structures are
given:

- Binary search
- Binary search tree (inserting and testing for existence only)
- Loop detection for linked lists ([Floyd's "Tortoise and Hare"
  algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_Tortoise_and_Hare))
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Equivalence class count using graph ("Baby names" example)
- Find kth number whose prime factors are restricted to a given set
- Count number of "2" digits in all numbers from 1 to n
